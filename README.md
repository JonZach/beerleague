Finished code:
Teams can be added
Our form validation isn't working.  It broke when we moved to use backflip and the fact that it can't link to external jQuery.

The form clears after the "Register Team" button is clicked.
When you click on the team names the team info appears.  

An internal delete function is working so that teams can be deleted from the line-up.  

When "start season" is clicked if there aren't 4 teams the season will not be allowed to start.  
If there are 4 or more teams the season will start and the team schedule will be populated.  If there are an odd number of teams a bye week notification present.

For each game played there is an empty score box that scores can be typed into.  An "enter score" button can be clicked to submit the scores and those scores along with the team names can be printed to the console.
